              	<h1>06/21/2015: Cold Temperature Test</h1>
	<p>Looking at the specifications of the components we want to use in this project, we found that some components might not work at cold temperature.</p>

	<p>We are living in the eastern part of Canada.	Here the winter temperature could go as low as -30°C.
	Most of the time it is not snowing when it is that cold outside. A reasonable lower operating temperature for our device is -20°C.
	We are now in June, it is a little bit difficult to test the prototype at -20°C. The best thing we could do is to try running it in the freezer.
	We tested the prototype in the freezer for more than 24 hours.
	The measure temperature in the freezer was -17°C which is pretty close to our target temperature.</p>

	</figure>
	<p>Because the lighting is not ideal in the freezer, I took two pictures with my cell phone. The first without the flash. In this one we could see that the LCD is working properly at -17°C.
	In the second picture (with the flash) we could see the protype in the freezer. Because of the flash, we could not read the LCD in that picture.</p>
	<p>This test shows that the device is working in cold temperature even if we are a little bit outside the official operating temperature given in the specifications.</p>
