We used a 3.3v Arduino mini pro instead of the original 5v Arduino, and we added a 5v to 3.3v level converter between the Arduino and the LCD. We are running the same code as in the original prototype. Nothing else was changed.<p>

<p>The top Arduino Uno (in blue) is running the pulse generator sketch. The 3.3v Arduino mini pro (with the red led on the bread board) is running the RPM counting sketch.
The cable attached to the LCD is leading to the level converter in the middle of the screen.</p>
