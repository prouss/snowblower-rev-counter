<a name="Wire"><h2>06/14/2015: Wire on spark plug cable</h2></a>
<p>Our original idea was to used a wire rolled over the spark cable to pick up the engine's ignition. In the tests we did with a multi-meter few weeks ago we measured a small current of about 100ÂµA.
This week, when we hooked our wire (terminated with a small resistance) to the oscilloscope, it was difficult to see a nice signal because there was too much noise.
A circuit to condition the signal is required before we could use it.
After our test, we found some interesting web pages where this approach is used.
This page is <a href="http://www.sportdevices.com/rpm_readings/index.htm">http://www.sportdevices.com/rpm_readings/index.htm</a> shows few circuits for sensing RPM from an engine.

<p>Because our engine has an alternator, we decided to get the rotation information from the AC coming out of the alternator.
It should be a little bit simpler to convert the AC from the alternator to a pulses that could be used by the Arduino.</p>
