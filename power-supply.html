<p>Before we start designing a power supply for our device, lets look at how the engine is
producing electrical power. The photo 1 below shows the engine's alternator (Tecumseh part number 611111).
According to the manufacturer, this is an 18 watts alternator. The photo 2 shows the flywheel with its
3 permanent magnets. The rotation of the permanent magnets inside the flywheel produce a variation
of the magnetic field inside the alternator's coils. The change of magnetic field induce a current in the coils
producing electrical power.
Because we did not find more detailed specifications for this alternator, we will have to perform some measurements
before we could finalize the design of our power supply.</p>

<p>For our initial power supply prototype, our idea was to first convert the AC power from the alternator to DC,
and then use a buck converter to convert it to 5 volts. We decided to use a buck converter instead of a linear regulator here
because it is an more efficient. Using a linear regulator would have waste to much energy.<p>
<p>The figure 1 below shows the rectifier that converts AC from the alternator to DC.</p>

<p>The photo 3 below shows our initial power supply components:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A rectifier (on the right side)</li>
	<li>The buck converter (on the top)</li>
	<li>Two resistors used to simulate loads</li>
</ul>
<p>The resistors used to simulate loads were picked to simulate a light load which include the power draw by the LCD and the Arduino,
and to simulate a heavier load which also include the power draw by the ESP8266 while it is transmitting data.</p>

<p>Our initial measurements for this initial power supply were flawed. We will post updated measurements later on.</p>
